                        <p>As a third-generation beekeeper I just happen to be tech savvy and able to create this mobile app.</p>
                        <p>Consistent inspection record keeping is critical for healthy hives. Combining my beekeeping heritage with my tech
                        experience, I came up with this app.</p>                        
                        <p>I believe that embracing technology can empower beekeepers of all ages to enhance their effectiveness and overcome the
                        perceived barrier of critical record keeping.</p>                        
                        <p>Thank you for your continued support!</p>
